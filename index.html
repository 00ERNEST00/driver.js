        <p>Let's you bring any component on the page into the spotlight.</p>
        <p>It lets you focus any element of the page while putting an overlay on top of the other elements in page. You can use it to make powerful introduction for different features of your application or for example if you want to highlight some component that needs user attention.</p>
